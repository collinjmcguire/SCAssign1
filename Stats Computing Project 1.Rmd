#Statistical Computing Project 1
###Collin McGuire

#####Initial Setup

First, we load the tidyverse package. Then we load in the Tidy Tuesday date from January 21, 2020, which we then save 

```{r Load Data}
library(tidyverse)
tuesdaydata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-01-21') ## Load the Tidy Tuesday data from 2020-01-21 and save as tuesdaydata
spotify_songs <- tuesdaydata$spotify_songs
glimpse(spotify_songs)
```

#####Part 1

For this section, we will make use of the dplyr function to answer some exploratory data analysis questions about the Spotify song data

```{r Song Data}
library(dplyr)
